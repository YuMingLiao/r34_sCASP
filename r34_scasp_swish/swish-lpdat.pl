% An implementation of Logic Programming with Defaults and Argumentation Theories

% These are the three predicates that the user should use in their code.
% they can also be customized to be displayed in a more friendly way, as can the
% other predicates. For example, to improve the display you can encode
% #pred according_to(R,flies(X)) :: 'according to rule @(R), @(X) flies'.
#pred rule(R) :: '@(R) is a rule'.
#pred conclusion(C) :: '@(C) is a conclusion'.
%#pred according_to(R,C) :: 'according to rule @(R), the conclusion @(C) holds'.
#pred overrides(R1,C1,R2,C2) :: 'the conclusion @(C1) from rule @(R1) overrides the conclusion @(C2) from rule @(R2)'.
#pred opposes(R1,C1,R2,C2) :: 'the conclusion @(C1) from rule @(R1) conflicts with the conclusion @(C2) from rule @(R2)'.

% Oppositions must be stated explicitly, and must be ground at evaluation time.
opposes(R1,C1,R2,C2) :- opposes(R2,C2,R1,C1).

% A rule is rebutted if it conflicts with another rule, neither is refuted, the rebutting rule is not compromised, and there is no priority between them.
#pred rebutted_by(R1,C1,R2,C2) :: 'the conclusion @(C1) from rule @(R1) is rebutted by the conclusion @(C2) from rule @(R2)'.

rebutted_by(Rule,Conclusion,Other_Rule,Other_Conclusion) :-
    according_to(Rule,Conclusion),
    according_to(Other_Rule,Other_Conclusion),
    opposes(Rule,Conclusion,Other_Rule,Other_Conclusion),
    not refuted(Rule,Conclusion),
    not refuted(Other_Rule,Other_Conclusion),
    not compromised(Other_Rule,Other_Conclusion),
    not overrides(Rule,Conclusion,Other_Rule,Other_Conclusion),
    not overrides(Other_Rule,Other_Conclusion,Rule,Conclusion).

% A rule is refuted if there is another rule that conflicts with it and overrides it.
#pred refuted_by(R1,C1,R2,C2) :: 'the conclusion @(C1) from rule @(R1) is refuted by the conclusion @(C2) from rule @(R2)'.
refuted_by(Rule,Conclusion,Other_Rule,Other_Conclusion) :-
    opposes(Rule,Conclusion,Other_Rule,Other_Conclusion),
    overrides(Other_Rule,Other_Conclusion,Rule,Conclusion),
    according_to(Rule,Conclusion),
    Rule \= Other_Rule,
    Conclusion \= Other_Conclusion,
    according_to(Other_Rule,Other_Conclusion).

% A rule is compromised if it is either refuted or defeated.
#pred compromised(Rule,Conclusion) :: 'the conclusion @(Conclusion) from rule @(Rule) is compromised'.

compromised(Rule,Conclusion) :-
    refuted_by(Rule,Conclusion,_,_).

%% Inserting this rule causes OLON problems.
compromised(Rule,Conclusion) :-
    defeated_by(Rule,Conclusion).

% A rule is disqualified if it defeats itself through a cycle of rebuttals or refutations (not disqualifications)
#pred defeated_by_closure(R1,C1,R2,C2) :: 'the conclusion @(C1) from rule @(R1) is defeated by closure by the conclusion @(C2) from rule @(R2)'.
