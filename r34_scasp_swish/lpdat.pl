% An implementation of Logic Programming with Defaults and Argumentation Theories

% These are the three predicates that the user should use in their code.
% they can also be customized to be displayed in a more friendly way, as can the
% other predicates. For example, to improve the display you can encode
% #pred according_to(R,flies(X)) :: 'according to rule @(R), @(X) flies'.
#pred rule(R) :: '@(R) is a rule'.
#pred conclusion(C) :: '@(C) is a conclusion'.
#pred according_to(R,C) :: 'according to rule @(R), the conclusion @(C) holds'.
#pred overrides(R1,C1,R2,C2) :: 'the conclusion @(C1) from rule @(R1) overrides the conclusion @(C2) from rule @(R2)'.
#pred opposes(R1,C1,R2,C2) :: 'the conclusion @(C1) from rule @(R1) conflicts with the conclusion @(C2) from rule @(R2)'.

% Oppositions must be stated explicitly, and must be ground at evaluation time.
opposes(R1,C1,R2,C2) :- opposes(R2,C2,R1,C1).

% A rule is rebutted if it conflicts with another rule, neither is refuted, the rebutting rule is not compromised, and there is no priority between them.
#pred rebutted_by(R1,C1,R2,C2) :: 'the conclusion @(C1) from rule @(R1) is rebutted by the conclusion @(C2) from rule @(R2)'.
